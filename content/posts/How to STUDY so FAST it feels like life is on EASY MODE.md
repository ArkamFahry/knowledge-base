Let's talk about studying some hate it some like it but most of us feel like studying is hard. What do we do when something we start procrastinating and wasting time rather trying to find the root of the problem?

So let's get started because I am going to make your brain go viral for the right reason for now on.

The truth is you're not the problem it's the boring and inefficient way that you have been taught to study. So I am going to guide you on a journey to study smarter, not harder.

First let's address the elephant in the room hours studied $\neq$ more knowledge. It's the way you study and how efficient you are at studying. There is that guy in our class who study fewer hours than you but gets better grades than you that means his studying methodology is more efficient. So I am going to guide you through a step-by-step guide on how to study like that cool person in your class by studying smarter, not harder.

## Step 01 Cut Out Sugary Snacks

Sugar is like kryptonite for people who study. In simple terms the more sugar you eat the less active you become. Sugar is like a drug it gives you instant energy boost and gratification while having the side effects slowing down your brain making it harder to focus and retain information. Also, I am not making this up scientific studies from UCLA proves that sugar reduces cognitive functions and impairs memory retention. So let's ditch the sweets and go for brain boosting alternatives like nuts, fish and berries. These healthy snacks will provide you with sustained energy, keeps your brain sharp and helps you stay focused longer without the dreaded sugar crash.


## Step 02 Positive Thinking Matters

Let's change our mindset to change our grade. Your mindset matters more than you think. Let's say you sit down to study while thinking it's going endless and boring it probably will be. On the other hand if you say to yourself it's going to be quick, easy and productive your brain will respond positively. I am not making these things up about positive thinking Harvard studies have proven that positive thinking can significantly boost performance. To see this in action try repeating affirmations like I can complete this topic in 30 minutes, or I can understand this topic easily when you think positively your brain releases chemicals which reduce stress and help you focus this makes it easy to absorb information faster.
