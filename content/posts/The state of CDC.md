Change Data Capture (CDC) stands out as the go-to method for maintaining data synchronization between databases and various sources. However, its implementation poses significant challenges due to the complexity of existing systems.

## Challenges in CDC implementation
- **Complexity:** Deploying and maintaining systems like Debezium, a popular CDC engine, prove daunting, particularly with their reliance on Kafka.
- **Resource Intensive:** Debezium's Docker images are notably large, demanding substantial resources for operation.
- **Configuration Hurdles:** Configuring Debezium can be intricate, amplifying the implementation complexity.
- **Vendor Lock-in Risks:** The prevalence of closed-source CDC engines in the market raises concerns about potential vendor lock-in.

## Issues specific to Debezium
- **Indirect Event Stream:** Applications cannot directly request a stream of table events from Debezium, necessitating routing through an event broker like Kafka.
- **Snapshot and CDC Event Retrieval:** Debezium lacks a user-friendly client SDK for applications to request both a snapshot and subsequent table CDC events.
- **Maintenance Demands:** Owing to its limitations and dependencies, Debezium poses challenges in terms of maintenance.
- **Lack of Alternatives:** A noticeable absence of lightweight alternatives to Debezium in the market further complicates the landscape.

The current state of CDC underscores the need for more accessible, lightweight, and adaptable solutions to effectively address the complexities associated with data synchronization.

## The Ideal CDC Engine
An ideal CDC engine should address the shortcomings of previous systems, such as Debezium, by providing a scalable, reliable, and lightweight solution for data synchronization. It should be designed to be cloud-native, supporting multi-tenancy and offering simplicity in deployment and use. The CDC engine should allow direct interaction through client SDKs and APIs, eliminating the need for a third-party event broker. It should utilize a lightweight event storage service like NATS or Redis and provide archiving capabilities to store old events efficiently.

In summary, the ideal CDC engine should:
- **Scale horizontally** to handle large data volumes and increasing demands.
- Ensure **reliable data capture and replication** even in the event of failures.
- Provide **high performance** with minimal latency for near-real-time data replication.
- Be **lightweight** to run efficiently on resource-constrained environments.
- Be **cloud-native** for scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.
- Support **multi-tenancy** for simultaneous use by multiple users or applications.
- Offer **simplicity** in deployment, configuration, and use with minimal dependencies.
- Enable **direct interaction** through client SDKs and APIs, reducing reliance on third-party brokers.
- Use **lightweight event storage** services like NATS or ValKey for efficient event storage.
- Support **archiving** of old events to Amazon S3 for preserving historical data and optimizing storage costs.

Such an engine would greatly simplify CDC implementation and maintenance, offering a more efficient and adaptable solution for data synchronization needs.
