Change Data Capture (CDC) is the preferred method for efficiently maintaining data synchronization between databases and various sources by tracking and capturing changes like inserts, updates, and deletes in real time. This real-time data delivery ensures systems remain synchronized without frequent bulk transfers, making CDC essential for modern data processing and integration. However, implementing CDC is challenging due to the complexity of existing solutions, which often require extensive configuration, high resource consumption, and reliance on third-party event brokers. These complexities hinder CDC adoption and effective use, highlighting the need for a more accessible, lightweight, and adaptable CDC solution to streamline data synchronization.

## Challenges with current CDC engines
- **Complexity:** Deploying and maintaining systems like Debezium, a popular CDC engine, prove daunting, particularly with their reliance on Kafka.
- **Resource Intensive:** Debezium's Docker images are notably large, demanding substantial resources for operation.
- **Configuration Hurdles:** Configuring Debezium can be intricate, amplifying the implementation complexity.
- **Vendor Lock-in Risks:** The prevalence of closed-source CDC engines in the market raises concerns about potential vendor lock-in.

### Issues specific to Debezium
- **Indirect Event Stream:** Applications cannot directly request a stream of table events from Debezium, necessitating routing through an event broker like Kafka.
- **Snapshot and CDC Event Retrieval:** Debezium lacks a developer friendly client API or SDK for an application to request both table snapshots and subsequent table events on demand.
- **Maintenance Demands:** Owing to its large size, limitations and dependencies, Debezium poses challenges in terms of maintenance.

The current state of CDC underscores the need for more accessible, lightweight, and adaptable solutions to effectively address the complexities associated with data synchronization.

## The Ideal CDC Engine
An ideal Change Data Capture (CDC) engine should address the shortcomings of previous systems, such as Debezium, by providing a scalable, reliable, and lightweight solution for data synchronization. It should be designed to be cloud-native, supporting multi-tenancy and offering simplicity in deployment and use. The CDC engine should allow direct interaction through developer friendly client APIs and SDKs, eliminating the need for a third-party event broker. It should utilize a lightweight event storage service like NATS or ValKey and provide archiving capabilities to store old events efficiently.

In summary, the ideal CDC engine should:
- **Scale Horizontally**: Handle large data volumes and increasing demands by distributing the load across multiple nodes.
- **Ensure Reliability**: Capture and replicate data consistently, even in the event of failures.
- **High Performance**: Deliver minimal latency for near-real-time data replication.
- **Lightweight**: Operate efficiently in containerized environments without consuming excessive resources.
- **Cloud-Native**: Offer scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness by leveraging cloud infrastructure.
- **Support Multi-Tenancy**: Allow multiple users or applications to use the engine simultaneously without interference.
- **Simplicity**: Facilitate easy deployment, configuration, maintenance, and usage with minimal external dependencies.
- **Direct Interaction**: Enable seamless interaction through developer friendly client APIs and SDKs, reducing the need for third-party brokers.
- **Efficient Event Storage**: Use lightweight event storage services like NATS or ValKey for managing event data.
- **Archiving Capabilities**: Store historical events in S3 to preserve data and optimize storage costs.

A reimagined CDC engine meeting these criteria would greatly simplify the implementation and maintenance processes, offering a more efficient and adaptable solution for data synchronization needs. By providing an easy-to-use, scalable, and reliable CDC engine, developers of all skill levels can integrate CDC into their applications more effectively. This widespread accessibility and ease of use would significantly enhance the adoption of CDC technology, enabling more organizations to benefit from real-time data synchronization and improved data consistency across their systems. As the landscape of data management continues to evolve, developing an ideal CDC engine becomes paramount in ensuring seamless, reliable, and efficient data synchronization in the modern data-driven world.
